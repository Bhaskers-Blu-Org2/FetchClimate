# FetchClimate
FetchClimate is a fast, free, intelligent climate data retrieval service that gives you the climate data you need. With FetchClimate, an Azure web service, you can retrieve data for any geographical region, at any grid resolution—global, continental, a few kilometers—and for any range of years, days within the year, or hours within the day. FetchClimate automatically selects the most appropriate data sources and can return information about the uncertainty of the data sources used. You can enable others to retrieve the same data by sharing a URL for your query.
